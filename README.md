# Linux Users Homes Management WebApp

This is a WebApp I developed during an internship in a cybersecurty company.
Once developed, I tried to exploit some vulnerabilities and I was successful.
I then went ahead and fixed those vulnerabilites.

## Functionality

It allows the creation of a user on the linux machine and then gives access to the its home folder.

#### Implemented features:
- Create, edit, move and delete folders and files.
- Download and Upload of files.
- Integrated text editor for text files.
- Search bar and sort filters.

## Technologies used
- Node.js as backend and Express.js as framwork.
- Jquery as the only frontend library; I didn't used any frontend frameworks but still obtained a clean and modern interface.
